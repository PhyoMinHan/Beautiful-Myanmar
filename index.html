                <h1 style="text-align:center;">Beautiful Myanmar</h1><br>
                <p><b>Myanmar</b> is a officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, also called Burma,is a country in Southeast Asia.It is the largest country in Mainland Southeast Asia, and has a population of about 54 million as of 2017.</p><br>
                <p>Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to its northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its south and southwest.</p><br><p>The country's capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon <b>(Rangoon)</b>.</p><br>
                <p>Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar.</p><br><p>In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the Burmese language, culture, and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. </p><p>The Pagan Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short period.</p>  
                <p>The early 19th-century Konbaung dynasty ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled Manipur and Assam as well.The British East India Company seized control of the administration of Myanmar after three Anglo-Burmese Wars in the 19th century, and the country became a British colony.After a brief Japanese occupation, Myanmar was reconquered by the Allies and gained independence in 1948.</p><br><p>Following a coup d'état in 1962, it became a military dictatorship under the Burma Socialist Programme Party.</p><br>
                <p>For most of its independent years, the country has been engrossed in rampant ethnic strife and its myriad ethnic groups have been involved in one of the world's longest-running ongoing civil wars. During this time, the United Nations and several other organisations have reported consistent and systemic human rights violations in the country.</p><p>In 2011, the military junta was officially dissolved following a 2010 general election, and a nominally civilian government was installed. </p>
                <p>This, along with the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and political prisoners and successful elections in 2015, had improved the country's human rights record and foreign relations and had led to the easing of trade and other economic sanctions,although the country's treatment of its ethnic minorities, particularly in connection with the Rohingya conflict, continued to be condemned by international organizations and many nations.</p><br>
                <p>Following the 2020 Myanmar general election, in which Aung San Suu Kyi's party won a clear majority in both houses, the Burmese military again seized power in a coup d'état.The coup, which was widely condemned, led to widespread protests in Myanmar and has been marked by a violent response by the military.The military also arrested Aung San Suu Kyi and charged her with crimes ranging from corruption to the violation of Covid protocols, all of which have been labele"politically motivated" by independent observers.</p><br>
                <p>Myanmar is a member of the East Asia Summit, Non-Aligned Movement, ASEAN, and BIMSTEC, but it is not a member of the Commonwealth of Nations despite once being part of the British Empire. It is a country rich in jade and gems, oil, natural gas, and other mineral resources. Myanmar is also endowed with renewable energy; it has the highest solar power potential compared to other countries of the Great Mekong Subregion.In 2013, its GDP (nominal) stood at US$56.7 billion and its GDP (PPP) at US$221.5 billion.
                The income gap in Myanmar is among the widest in the world, as a large proportion of the economy is controlled by supporters of the military government.As of 2020, according to the Human Development Index, Myanmar ranks 147 out of 189 countries in human development.</p><br>
